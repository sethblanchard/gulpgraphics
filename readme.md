# Gulp Graphics Starter

This gulp setup was based on the much more excellent (Gulp Starter Repo)[https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter] and associted (blog post)[http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq]. If this is new to you definitely start there. 

## Getting Started 

Assuming you have Node and NPM installed. If you need Gulp then just:
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Then you will need to install the packages we are missing:
```
npm install
```

### Start Gulp
And never ever ever go back.
```
gulp
```
